To run:
	type "make"
	type "./oss"

To cleanup:
	type "make clean"

Statistics about execution are stored in a file called "osstest", and also printed to the screen.
The program uses the LRU page replacement algorithm to create space in physical memory so it 
may continue filling requests.
Each time a process is spawed the clock is progressed random # 1-500ms, this occurs if there
are less than 12 processes in the system and may never be exceeded.
Child processes may terminate after 1000+-100 requests have been made.  A non-page fault request
progresses the clock by 10ns and a page faulting request must wait 15ms to be filled.
Throughput is the number of process that ran to completion.
Turn around time is calculated by (time process terminated - time process entered the system)
Wait time is how long a process spent waiting for requests.
Utilization is the amount of time oss progressed the clock / the total time.
Process requests were not printed as it would make the file huge and unable to read.
The memory map for oss is printed every 20 logical seconds for this same reason.
Process's indicate their termination in the log file as well as the memory access time they experienced.
